  "Real cross-repo proof: anime.production cut-sequence -> anime.timeline's
  REAL cut-sequence->timeline adapter -> a real kami.eizo.timeline EDL ->
  the REAL douga.eizo-timeline/render-plan + douga.ffmpeg command builders
  -> a real ffmpeg subprocess -> a correct playable video, verified with
  real ffprobe + real pixel sampling. This exercises anime + kami-eizo-timeline
  + douga's actual code together for the first time; nothing here is
  hand-simulated. Pattern mirrors douga's own
  `test/e2e/real_ffmpeg_proof.cljs` (Wave-8 real-ffmpeg-execution-proof) —
  same subprocess helpers, same ffprobe/pixel-sample verification technique,
  applied one level up the stack at the anime-producer end.

  GENUINE INTEGRATION GAP this script has to bridge (not simulated away):
  `anime.timeline/cut-sequence->timeline` deliberately only knows about
  anime's own vocabulary — a clip's `:clip/source-id` is the cut's
  `:cut/id` itself (an opaque production identifier, not a renderable
  asset path), and clips carry no `:douga/scene-index` (a douga-specific
  key anime's adapter has no reason to know about — see its docstring:
  it produces a *generic* kami.eizo.timeline value, not a douga-flavored
  one). `douga.eizo-timeline/render-plan` requires both. So a real
  end-to-end pipeline needs a real \"asset resolution + scene numbering\"
  bridging step between the two adapters — exactly the kind of seam a
  real production pipeline has (cut id -> rendered/composited asset blob
  key is always a separate resolution step). That bridge is written out
  explicitly below (see `attach-douga-keys`), not hidden inside either
  library.

  Requires: system `ffmpeg` + `ffprobe` on PATH, run from the anime repo
  root with douga's and kami-eizo-timeline's `src/` on classpath:

    nbb -cp src:test/e2e:<path-to-douga>/src:<path-to-kami-eizo-timeline>/src \\
        test/e2e/real_anime_douga_ffmpeg_proof.cljs

  Exits 0 with a PASS report on success, 1 with the failing checks printed
  on failure. Never fabricates a pass: every check is a real measurement
  of a real file produced by a real ffmpeg subprocess."
